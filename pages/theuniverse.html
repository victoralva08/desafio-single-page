        <h2>The Universe</h2> 

        <p>The word 'Universe' comes from latin 'universum'. The word was after used by Cícero and other authors with the same interpretation that is applied nowadays. The word comes from the poetic contraction 'unvorsum' — firstly used by Lucrécio in the Book IV of “De rerum natura (The Nature of Things)” — that joins un, uni (one) with vorsum, versum (which means "something that spinned, rolled or changed").
